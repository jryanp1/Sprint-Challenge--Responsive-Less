> If you had to teach someone with basic knowledge of a CSS preprocessor how would you describe it?

Pre-processors extend CSS with variables, operators, interpolations, functions, mixins and many more other usable assets. Some cool things about preprocessors:
Using one allows you to use mixins like simple javascript functions, passing variables in etc. You can use @extend to attribute a set of one class' attributes to another class also. Another thing students might mention is that you can use mathematical operators to adjust layout variables in relation to others,  for example: padding-top:  $nav-height +40px;. You can also use for loops  by using the @for keyword or the other kinds of loops utilizing @each, @while etc.
